# Small disk scanning utility (node js)
#### This is a work in progress

# Approach
<p>Scan the given directory and check for duplicates</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Fetch all the files and directories in a list</li>
<li>Check if folder or a file</li>
<li>Group all files with the same names</li>
<li>If the names are the same asssume to be duplicates</li>
<li>Show all the list of duplicates and the path</li>
<ul>

### Depth
The depth of scanning I will reach as 1, thus scan inside the subfolders at the root level
